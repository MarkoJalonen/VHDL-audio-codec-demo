preliminary documentation for audio_ctrl block

  in:
    clk
    rst_n
    left_data_in[15:0]
    right_data_in[15:0]

  out:
    aud_bclk_out	      -- BCLK	may not change even if ref_clk_freg_g changes
    			              -- sample_rate_g * data_width_g * 2
                        -- two 16 bit channels at 48 kHz 
    aud_lrclk_out	      -- WCLK	may not change even if ref_clk_freg_g changes
    aud_data_out	      -- DATIN

  generic:
    ref_clk_freq_g, 12 288 000 (Hz)
    sample_rate_g,      48 000 (Hz)	
    data_width_g,           16 (bits)

  timing
    BCLK period		min	75	ns	(insignificant considering freq)
    BCLK and WCLK	+/-     30	%
    WCLK setup time 	min	7 	ns	(insignificant considering freq)
    WCLK hold time	min	2	2	(insignificant considering freq)
    WCLK must be high for at least the word length number of BCLK periods
    WCLK must be low for at least the word length number of BCLK periods

  clock counters must be calculated at runtime from ref_clk_freq_g
  counters only flip the clock signal thus they are divided by 2
  bclk   = ref_clk_freq_g / ( sample_rate_g * data_width_g * 2 ) / 2
  lrclk  = ref_clk_freg_g / data_width_g / 2
  all processes run synchronously, sensitive only to clk and rst_n
       

  functional description
    1. input channels are sampled at the start of each sample cycle
    2. samples are written into a two word register
    3. at a falling edge of bitclock:
         -lrclk is set high
         -data MSB is written to the line, left channel
    4. after the word is written at a falling edge of bitclock:
         -lrclk is set low
 	 -data MSB is written to the line, right channel
    5. repeat after LSB

    processes include clock counters and a read/write process
